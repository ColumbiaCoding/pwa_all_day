## Description

We will build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.

## Purpose

As a developer, I want to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection so that I can reliably retrieve them for later use
